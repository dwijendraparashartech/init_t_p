How Does Ruby Deal With Extremely Large Numbers?

Answer :

Unlike other programming languages ruby deals with extremely large numbers it doesn’t have any barriers. There is no limit on the extent of limit of number usage. Ruby performs this function with two different classes they are fixnum and bignum. Fixnum represents easily managed small numbers and bignum represents big numbers. Ruby entirely handles the functioning of these two classes which leaves a programmer to concentrate on his arithmetic operations.


13.   
Explain About Portability?

Answer :

Ruby language can be ported to many platforms. Ruby programs can be ported to many platforms without any modification to the source code. This feature made the language very useful and highly used by many programmers worldwide. Some of the platforms used are DOS, UNIX, WINDOWS, etc. 

14.

Path=> rootpath conf/environment.rb
config.frameworks = [ action_web_service, :action_mailer, :active_record]


19.   

100) What is the difference between throw/catch and raise/rescue?

Answer– Throw and catch accept matching symbols as arguments and should be considered a control-flow structure where raise and rescue is used to raise and handle exceptions. throw and catch are not commonly used while exception handling with raise and rescue is used often.

20.

What is concatenating string in Ruby. In how many ways you can create a concatenating string.
Ruby concatenating string implies creating one string from multiple strings. You can join more than one string to form a single string by concatenating them.

There are four ways to concatenate Ruby strings into single string:

Using plus sign in between strings.
Using a single space in between strings.
Using << sign in between strings.
Using concat method in between strings.

21.

 In how many ways you can compare Ruby string?
Ruby strings can be compared with three operators:

With == operator : Returns true or false
With eql? Operator : Returns true or false
With casecmp method : Returns 0 if matched or 1 if not matched

22. 
There are three ways to invoke a method in ruby. Can you give me at least two?
Here, I'm looking for the dot operator (or period operator), the Object#send method, or method(:foo).call

object = Object.new
puts object.object_id
 #=> 282660

puts object.send(:object_id)
 #=> 282660

puts object.method(:object_id).call # (Kudos to Ezra)

 24. 

 What is unit testing (in classical terms)? What is the primary technique when writing a test?
The strongest candidates should be quite comfortable with test or behavior driven development.

Unit testing, simply put, is testing methods -- the smallest unit in object-oriented programming. Strong candidates will argue that it allows a developer to flesh out their API before it's consumed by other systems in the application.

The primary way to achieve this is to assert that the actual result of the method matches an expected result.

require "test/unit"

class Brokened
  def uh_oh
    "I needs fixing"
  end
end

class BrokenedTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_uh_oh
    actual = Brokened.new
    assert_equal("I'm all better!", actual.uh_oh)
  end
end
 #=> Started
 #=> F
 #=> Finished in 0.663831 seconds.
 #=> 
 #=>   1) Failure:
 #=> test_uh_oh:11
 #=> <"I'm all better!"> expected but was
 #=> <"I needs fixing">.
 #=> 
 #=> 1 tests, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors

To delete a file, following syntax is used. 

Syntax: 
File.delete("file.txt") 
============================= 

...

How do you import files or packages or modules in ruby?

In ruby, we can import with ‘load’ and ‘require’ keyword is used to load packages or modules.

The load method includes the ruby file every time it is being executed.

   load ‘filename.rb’
The commonly used require method includes the ruby file only once.

   require ‘filename’
   require ‘./filename’
For example:

To import file with ‘require’ keyword

Create a file with hello.rb with following code implementation

//--------start code--------------
class Hello
 def print
puts "Hello"
 end
end
//-------end code--------------
Now create a new file with name print_hello.rb with following code implementation
//------start code--------
require './hello'
x = Hello.new
x.print
//----end code--------
Now run the above file from terminal
//-----------------
$ ruby print_hello.rb
Hello
$
//-----------
To import file with ‘load’ keyword
Create a new file with name print_hello2.rb with following code implementation
//------start code--------
load 'hello.rb’
x = Hello.new
x.print
//----end code--------
Now run the above file from terminal
//-----------------
$ ruby print_hello2.rb
Hello
$
//-----------

...

Explain the role of thread pooling in relation to the thread lifecycle in Ruby?
In Ruby, the lifecycle of a single thread starts automatically as soon as CPU resources are available. The thread runs the code in the block where it was instantiated and obtains the value of the last expression in that block and returns it upon completion. Threads use up resources but running multiple threads at a time can improve an app’s performance. 

Thread pooling is a technique wherein multiple pre-instantiated reusable threads are left on standby, ready to perform work when needed. 

Thread pooling is best used when there are a large number of short tasks that must be performed. This avoids the overhead of having to create a new thread every time a small task is about to be performed. 

...

What are some built-in Ruby class exceptions.
Built-in subclasses of exception are as follows:

What does the “Action Controller” do in Ruby on Rails?

Answer: Ruby on Rails supports the MVC design pattern, and the “Action Controller” is the “Controller” (C) in the case of this framework. The router determines the controller it should use while serving a request. The “Action Controller” then understands the request.

It produces the desired output. To do this, the controller receives the request. The controller in Ruby on Rails handles the routing of external requests to internal actions. It then fetches or saves data from a model. The controller then uses a view to create the HTML output. “Action Controllers” act as intermediaries between models and views by making the model data available to Views.

...

What is the difference between dynamic and static scaffolding?

Answer: Dynamic Scaffolding automatically generates the entire content and user interface at runtime. Static Scaffolding requires the insertion of the command to generate the data with their fields.

...

Provide a few examples of using a “subdirectory” in Ruby on Rails.

The following are a few examples:

The “App” directory: It loads with all subdirectories that are required for your Ruby on Rails application.
“App”/”controllers”: When a user makes a web request, the “controller” handles it. The Rails framework looks for the “controller” classes in the “controller subdirectory”.
“App”/”Helpers”: The Ruby on Rails framework uses a “helpers subdirectory”, which holds the helper classes. These classes help the view, model, and controller classes to function.


...

State where Ruby on Rails might not be the best choice of the development framework.

Answer: Do you plan to create a web application with CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations on a database, and do you intend to use the MVC pattern? Ruby on Rails works very well. However, it won’t work well in the following instances:

You need foreign keys in databases.
The application needs to link with many databases simultaneously.
You need to use SOAP web services.
The application needs to establish connections with multiple database servers simultaneously.

...

Can a Ruby on Rails application run without creating a database?

Answer: A developer can do this by uncommenting the following lines in “environment.rb”.


Path=> rootpath conf/environment.rb
config.frameworks = [ action_web_service, :action_mailer, :active_record]

5. Write A Function in Ruby To Check if The String is Empty.
The question refers to Ruby basic coding exercises, asking such basic to intermediate coding problems will help you determine if the candidate is fit for the entry-level role.

Again you can check how long the candidate takes to solve basic coding problems without failing any test cases.

Expected Explanation-

We can use the built-in empty? method to check if the string is empty or not.

The method empty? returns true if the string is empty, else it returns false.  

Expected Code- 

 

fruit name = “”

 

if name.empty?

   puts “string is empty”

else

   puts “string is not empty”

end

Expected Output-

“string is empty”

There are a few limitations of the Ruby on Rails framework as it is made for building MVC-based CRUD applications.

>Databases and their foreign keys.
>Less Flexibility.
>Boot Speed.
>Documentation.
>Linking huge databases at the same time.
>Web services for soap.
>Numerous database servers are connected at the same time.

...
How is Ruby on Rails different from other web application frameworks? 
Answer: 

Note that this question isn’t about quizzing people on what paradigms Rails is built on. Instead, listen to their answer to get an idea of how well they understand the framework and why someone would choose to use Rails rather than other frameworks. 

Ruby on Rails was created with different paradigms in mind, which are programmer happiness, convention over configuration, progress over stability, the menu is omakase, no one paradigm, exalt beautiful code, provide sharp knives, value integrated systems, and push up a big tent. Most of these paradigms have a different approach than other frameworks; for instance, programmer happiness is seldom taken into account and web development has traditionally been seen as just “a tool.” 

...

s Ruby as a language statically or dynamically typed? 
Answer: 

Ruby is dynamically typed, which means that you can change the type of a variable as you go. These lines of code, run one after the other, do not throw an error. 

x = 1

x = "foo"

///

What’s the meaning of “Fat models, skinny controllers”? 
Answer: 

Controllers just pass information between views and models, so business logic shouldn’t exist in controllers, but in models. Logic becomes easier to unit test and reuse. However, “Fat models, skinny controllers” isn’t necessarily recommended in large apps. 



...

 How does Ruby on Rails implement Ajax (Asynchronous Javascript and XML)? 
Answer: 

Ajax, which uses asynchronous data transfer between the browser and web server, retrieves web pages from the server. Ruby on Rails triggers Ajax in these ways: 

Web client calls the server: XMLHttpRequest, a JavaScript method, sends data linked with the trigger to an action handler on the server. The data might be the whole form, the text in the entry field, or the ID of a checkbox. 

Some trigger fires: The triggers include a user making changes to the data in the field or on a form or clicking a link or a button. 

Client receives the response: Rails generates client-side JavaScript automatically. It receives the HTML fragment and uses it to update a specific part of the current. 



...

 What is the role of Rails Controller? 
Answer: 

The Rails controller, which is the logical center of an app, facilitates the interaction between users, the model, and views. 

It can route external requests to internal actions and handles URLs extremely well.

It also regulates helper modules so that the capabilities of the view templates can be extended without bulking their code. 

And it regulates sessions so that users are given the impression of an ongoing interaction with the applications.

...

How can you create view files in Rails?
Create a new file and store with any name.The name should be followed by ".html.erb"

For example index.html.erb inside app/views directory.

“erb” stands for Embedded Ruby. When you define any file as ".html.erb" that means it is an HTML file with ruby code embedded in it.

Following is the syntax of using Ruby with HTML -

<% %>   # executes the Ruby script
<%= %>  # executes the Ruby script and displays the result

...

How will you configure the database in Rails?
You can connect to the database 

by setting an environment variable ENV['DATABASE_URL'] 
by using a configuration file called config/database.yml.
Using the config/database.yml file you can specify all the information needed to access your database:

development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: blog_development
  pool: 5
This will connect to the database named blog_development using the sqlite3 adapter. 

This same information can be stored in a URL and provided via an environment variable like this:

> puts ENV['DATABASE_URL']
postgresql://localhost/blog_development?pool=5

...

To create a new rails application you need to use the following command

...............................


1. What experience do you have with developing web applications using Ruby on Rails?
Interviewers want to know that you have the technical skills and experience to do the job. This question gives you an opportunity to talk about your experience with the Ruby on Rails framework and the projects you’ve worked on using it. You’ll also be able to show off your problem-solving skills with specific examples of how you used the framework to solve a particular problem.

How to Answer:

Start by giving a brief overview of your experience with the framework, including any projects or applications you’ve built. Then provide specific examples of how you used Ruby on Rails to solve a particular problem. If possible, include details about the features you implemented and the outcomes of those changes. Finally, make sure to explain why you chose Ruby on Rails for that project and what made it the best solution in that situation.

Example: “I have over five years of experience developing web applications using Ruby on Rails. I’ve built a variety of projects ranging from small internal tools to large-scale customer-facing systems. For example, I recently worked on an e-commerce application that required custom payment processing and user authentication features. To solve this problem, I used the Ruby on Rails framework to create a secure system with robust data validation and encryption capabilities. The project was successful in meeting all of our client’s requirements and was delivered ahead of schedule.”

...

2. Describe your approach to debugging and troubleshooting code written in Ruby on Rails.
Debugging and troubleshooting code is a key skill for any programmer, and the ability to do this quickly and efficiently is a must-have for a Ruby on Rails developer. An interviewer will want to know how you approach debugging and troubleshooting tasks, what strategies you use, and how you use the tools available to you. They may also be interested in hearing about any challenges you’ve faced, and how you overcame them.

How to Answer:

Start by describing the process you use to debug and troubleshoot code written in Ruby on Rails. Explain how you go about finding the source of an issue, what tools you use (such as logging or debugging tools), and any strategies you use to make sure that you’re able to identify and solve problems quickly. If there are any particular challenges that you’ve faced, explain how you overcame them. Finally, be sure to emphasize your ability to learn new techniques and adapt your approach if needed.

Example: “My approach to debugging and troubleshooting code written in Ruby on Rails is to first identify the issue at hand, then break it down into smaller pieces. I like to use a systematic process of elimination by starting with the model layer and working my way up through the view and controller layers. Once I have identified the root cause of the problem, I can then focus on finding the most efficient solution. Additionally, I am very familiar with various debugging tools such as Pry or Byebug which are extremely helpful for pinpointing problems and testing out solutions.”

...


3. Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture? How does it apply to Ruby on Rails development?
The MVC architecture is integral to the way that Ruby on Rails works. The interviewer wants to know that you understand the basics of this framework and how it can be used to help you create effective software. This question also allows you to showcase your knowledge of the technical side of Ruby on Rails development.

How to Answer:

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller and it is a software design pattern that divides an application into three distinct parts: the model, the view, and the controller. The model is responsible for managing data and business logic; the view handles user interface elements such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and the controller acts as a bridge between the two, taking input from the user and sending it to the model. In Ruby on Rails development, the MVC architecture helps developers create applications quickly and efficiently by dividing up the work into manageable chunks of code.

Example: “I am very familiar with the Model-View-Controller architecture and its application to Ruby on Rails development. The MVC framework helps developers create applications quickly by dividing up tasks into manageable chunks of code, which makes it great for rapid prototyping and iterative development. I have used this architecture extensively in my past projects when developing web applications using Ruby on Rails.”

Various compoennts in rails ?

4. What Are The Various Components Of Rail?
Action Pack: Action Pack is a single gem that contains Action Controller, Action View and Action Dispatch. The “VC” part of “MVC”.
Action Controller: Action Controller is the component that manages the controllers in a Rails application. The Action Controller framework processes incoming requests to a Rails application, extracts parameters, and dispatches them to the intended action.
Services provided by Action Controller include session management, template rendering, and redirect management.
Action View: Action View manages the views of your Rails application. It can create both HTML and XML output by default.
Action View manages rendering templates, including nested and partial templates, and includes built-in AJAX support.
Action Dispatch: Action Dispatch handles routing of web requests and dispatches them as you want, either to your application or any other Rack application. Rack applications are a more advanced topic and are covered in a separate guide called Rails on Rack.
Action Mailer: Action Mailer is a framework for building e-mail services. You can use Action Mailer to receive and process incoming email and send simple plain text or complex multipart emails based on flexible templates.
Active Model: Active Model provides a defined interface between the Action Pack gem services and Object Relationship Mapping gems such as Active Record. Active Model allows Rails to utilize other ORM frameworks in place of Active Record if your application needs this.
Active Record: Active Record are like Object Relational Mapping (ORM), where classes are mapped to table, objects are mapped to columns and object attributes are mapped to data in the table.
Active Resource: Active Resource provides a framework for managing the connection between business objects and RESTful web services. It implements a way to map web-based resources to local objects with CRUD semantics.
Active Support: Active Support is an extensive collection of utility classes and standard Ruby library extensions that are used in Rails, both by the core code and by your applications.

Q- 

13. Get And Post Method?
GET is basically for just getting (retrieving) data, whereas POST may involve anything, like storing or updating data, or ordering a product, or sending E-mail.



...
Q-

 What Is The Log That Has To Seen To Check For An Error In Ruby Rails?
Rails will report errors from Apache in log/apache.log and errors from the ruby code in log/development.log. If you having a problem, do have a look at what these log are saying.

...
Q- 

15. Difference Between Render And Redirect?
render example: render :action, render :partial etc. redirect example: redirect_to :controller => ‘users’, :action => ‘new’



...

18. Render Vs. Redirect_to In Ruby On Rails ?
render will render a particular view using the instance variables available in the action.
For example if a render was used for the new action, when a user goes to /new, the new action in the controller is called, instance variables are created and then passed to the new view. Rails creates the html for that view and returns it back to the user's browser. This is what you would consider a normal page load.
redirect_to will send a redirect to the user’s browser telling it to re-request a new URL as 302 redirect response. Then the browser will send a new request to that URL and it will go through the action for that URL, oblivious to the fact that it was redirected to. None of the variables created in the action that caused the redirect will be available to the redirected view. This is what happens when you click on ‘Create’ in a form and the object is created and you’re redirected to the edit view for that object.
...


20. What Is The Flash?
The flash is a special part of the session which is cleared with each request. This means that values stored there will only be available in the next request, which is useful for storing error messages etc. It is accessed in much the same way as the session, like a hash.
flash is a object of Actiondispatch class.

imp interview questions ;some ::

Ruby Developer Interview Questions
Question: Can you explain some advantages of using Ruby to write an application?

Explanation: This is an example of an opening or general question. An interviewer will ask this type of question early in the interview to get you talking, learn more about your background, and gather information they can use for additional questions

Example: “I prefer to code with Ruby because it is a pure object-oriented language. What this means is everything within Ruby is an object, including methods, classes, and booleans. This makes coding much simpler. The other thing I like about Ruby is that it’s 100% open-sourced, so it’s being improved continuously. There’s also a large collection of libraries available.”

Question: Many people describe Ruby as a flexible language. Do you agree with this?

Explanation: This is another general question in which the interviewer is trying to learn a little bit more about your background. There is no right or wrong answer to this question, but it will give the interviewer some perspective as to why you are applying for a job as a Ruby developer.

Example: “Yes, I agree that Ruby is a very flexible language. This is because it allows programmers to alter the elements within the code.  Parts of the lineage can be removed or redefined without any restrictions. An example of this is adding two numbers. Ruby allows you to use the + sign or the word plus.”

Question: Can you list some features of Ruby that you like?

Explanation: By asking this question, the interviewer is testing your knowledge of Ruby. Your answer will indicate the features you use. You should include the most advanced features with which you are familiar. You should also prepare for follow-up questions when you provide your answer.

Example: “Ruby is a feature-rich programming language. I’ve already mentioned that it is object-oriented and flexible; other key features include dynamic and duck typing, a garbage collector to remove unwanted code, and keyword arguments.”

Question: What does freezing an object mean in Ruby, and how would you do this? 

Explanation: This is a technical question which the interviewer will ask to begin testing your skills in Ruby programming. As a programmer, you can anticipate that the majority of the interview will be technical questions. The best way to prepare for these questions is to review the job posting. The employer is likely to list the specific requirements they are looking for.

Example: “Freezing an object in Ruby means to prevent the object from being changed. You can accomplish this using the freeze method which is merely adding the code .freeze after the object’s name.”

Question:  Please list the variables Ruby uses and provide a brief definition for each of them.

Explanation: This is another technical question. The best way to respond to technical questions is directly and concisely. The interviewer will ask follow-up questions if they need additional information.

Example: “There are four different types of variables within Ruby. The first of our global variables begin with the dollar sign and are accessible from anywhere within a Ruby program. The next type is local variables. The scope of a local variable is limited to the code construct within which it is declared. Class variables are shared by all instances of the class in which they are defined. Finally, instance variables begin with @ and are similar to class variables except they are local to a single class in which they are defined.”

Question: Can you explain how thread pooling relates to the thread lifecycle in Ruby?

Explanation: By now, you should recognize this as a technical question. In addition to reviewing the job description, you should also brush up on your Ruby commands, syntax, and structure. This will prepare you to answer specific technical questions the interviewer is likely to ask.

Example: “As you may know, the lifecycle of a single thread begins as soon as computing resources become available. Threads use a lot of resources within a Ruby program, but using multiple simultaneous threads improves the performance of an application. Thread pooling involves using multiple reusable threads. These are created and then stored until the program calls them. This minimizes much of the overhead required by threads. Thread pooling works best when the program as a large number of small tasks.”

Question: Can you discuss how Ruby looks up a method it needs to invoke?

Explanation: This is yet another technical question. As the interview progresses, the questions will become more specific and more difficult. This indicates the interviewer is becoming more confident in your skills and abilities and is willing to explore more complex topics.

Example: “Ruby first looks for a method in the object’s class that contains methods directly defined on the object, known as the metaclass. If the method cannot be found in an object’s metaclass, Ruby will then search for the method in the forerunners of an object’s class. Programmers can also invoke a method missing command to prevent Ruby from continuing to search for the method.”

Question: Please discuss the roles of modules and mixins and how they are used in Ruby.

Explanation: The interviewer is continuing to probe your knowledge of Ruby programming by asking about specific components of the language. If you researched the company and the products they produce before the interview, you’ll be prepared for these types of questions. You may also want to conduct informational interviews with some of the company’s other programmers to learn more about the type of coding they do. These are informal conversations you have with people who may be your peers in the organization.

Example: “Ruby uses modules to group methods, classes, and constants. The program then provides a namespace that will prevent clashes between different names. Mixins enable the modules to share code between different classes. This allows programmers to continue to use the single inheritance paradigm feature within Ruby.”

Question: Can you discuss what unit testing is and describe what you are trying to accomplish when writing a test?

Explanation: As a qualified candidate for this position, you should be comfortable with test or behavior-driven development. The interviewer is continuing to ask specific technical questions. Keep in mind that any response to a technical question may result in a follow-up question which is why it’s best to keep your answers brief and to the point.

Example: “Unit testing is used to verify methods which are the smallest unit in Ruby programming. This enables a developer to clean up an API before other routines consume it within the application. It also verifies the actual result of the method matches an expected result.”

Question: What is RubyGems?

Explanation: This is another technical question asking for a definition of a specific component of Ruby.

Example: “Gems is the name for libraries within Ruby. RubyGems is a package manager software for Ruby libraries. This package manager addresses basic operations and dependency trees and supports asynchronous communication between multiple Gem servers. It is an essential tool used by Ruby programmers to simplify the code and save time.”

A word of warning when using question lists.
Question lists offer a convenient way to start practicing for your interview. Unfortunately, they do little to recreate actual interview pressure. In a real interview you’ll never know what’s coming, and that’s what makes interviews so stressful.

Go beyond question lists using interview simulators.
With interview simulators, you can take realistic mock interviews on your own, from anywhere.

My Interview Practice offers a simulator that generates unique questions each time you practice, so you’ll never see what’s coming. There are questions for over 120 job titles, and each question is curated by actual industry professionals. You can take as many interviews as you need to, in order to build confidence.
