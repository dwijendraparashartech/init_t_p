Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. This means that in Ruby programs we work with objects.  These objects are created and modified during the lifetime of a Ruby script.

Types of Objects ::

Built-in objects and Custom objects

..........................

 Built-in objects are predefined objects that all programmers can use. They are available with the core of the Ruby language or from various libraries. 

 Custom objects are created by application programmers for their application domains.
