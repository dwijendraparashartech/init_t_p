what are the csv files in rails ::: 
CSV ---  "Comma-Seperated-Values"
csv are the "Comma-Seperated-Values".It is common data format which consist of rows with values seperated by commas.It's used for exporting and importing data.

Example of CSV Files ::
You can sexport your gmail contacts as CSV File, and you can also import them using the same format.

What a Csv file looks like ::

id,name
1,chocolate
2,bacon
3,apple
4,banana
5,almonds

how to import csv files in rails ::

1. make the method self.import(file) in the model
2. add some functionalitis in the create method in the controller 
3. make a form for import csv files in the view files 
................

1.  At first in the model, as like country.rb and we have two columns for a country which is name and code see the below

class Country < ApplicationRecord
    # Bulk upload companies
    def self.import(file)
        CSV.foreach(file.path, headers: true) do |row|
            company_hash = Country.new
            company_hash.name = row[0]
            company_hash.code = row[1]
            company_hash.save
        end
    end
end

2. now we can add some functionalities in our countries controller

class CountriesController < ApplicationController

   def new
      @country = Country.new
   end

   def create
     Country.import(params[:country][:file]
     flash[:notice] = "Countries uploaded successfully"
     redirect_to countries_path #=> or where you want
   end

end

3. now final touch in our new.html.erb I mean CSV upload form

<%= form_for @country, url: countries_path do |f| %>
   <div class="form-group">
      <%= f.label :file, "Upload CSV File" %>
      <%= f.file_field :file, class: 'form-control-file', required: true %>
   </div>
   <%= f.button :submit, "Upload CSV", class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
<% end %>
