For the client side, use HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, AngularJS, and jQuery;
For the server side, use Ruby on Rails.
It should have client side and server side validation;
It should work like a single-page WEB application and should use AJAX technology (load and submit data without reloading a page);
It should have a user authentication solution. The user should only have access to his/her own projects and tasks (Devise, Cancancan);
It should have automated tests for all functionality (models - RSpec, controllers - RSpec, acceptance/functional tests - RSpec + Capybara);
